# Portfolio

https://baskin-ridley.github.io/portfolio/

## Motivation

I had spent a lot of time practicing my JavaScript and React but had been neglecting my CSS skills. Which is why a visual first project like a portfolio would be perfect too get my CSS up to speed.

This is a portfolio website for my personal projects, it is built using React, TypeScript, and Sass. It is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop. It is hosted on Github Pages.

## What I learned

The Portfolio website taught me greatly about advanced CSS techniques including animations and transitions, it also required me to use a mix of CSS-Grid and Flexbox in ways that I had tried yet.

## Features

Email contact form built with Formspree API.
Carousel built with Embla-Carousel.
On Desktop, half the page is sticky, and does not scroll and there is also a cool overlaying effect both built in CSS.
